### Summary

It is a world where demons live.
>Deep in a forest where crows' caws echo is a large,
>antique mansion. The demon girl Kurotsuno lives there,
>passing the time with her unusual friends.
>Her favorite things are sweet pastries, chocolate, and...
>
>the beautiful full moon in the night sky.

The story follows the demon girl, Kurotsuno, doing all sorts of things with her friends, without any rhyme or reason. It's an extremely short read that helps show Kurotsuno and her relationship with her friends, and her only family, Sullivan. Though sadly, the series never got expanded due to the author abandoning it at a very early stage, only reaching the 7th chapter.
